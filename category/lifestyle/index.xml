      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I wrote 2 test papers: on mathematical logic and on mathematical analysis. I also passed an oral exam in English and gave one of the last lectures on mathematical analysis on Friday. At the end of the week, I did the last laboratory and the last stage of the individual project. And after all that, I rested.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I wrote 2 test papers: on mathematical logic and on mathematical analysis. And at the end of the week I slept off. In English classes, we rehearsed an oral exam, and on Saturday we wrote a test for the 5th unit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I read a lot, studied and did my homework on university subjects, just like last week.
I celebrated my mother&amp;rsquo;s birthday, made her a postcard for the first time in the format of a graphic file.
I discovered a lot of new things for myself from the book. It concerned the work of our brain, our beliefs and how they can be influenced.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I prepared and successfully presented a report on OS, read, studied and did homework on university subjects, tried to delve into matanalysis (it even turned out), gave a lecture on matanalysis for my direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the week, due to the holidays, the state was very lazy, but in the end I had to gather in a bunch and do everything necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discussed a lot with people close to me and came to the conclusion that it would be extremely important to try to recreate my family tree with the most extensive information on my relatives. Even though it may take quite a long time, it will never be too late to do it. This is useful for a greater understanding of yourself, your loved ones, your and their worldview. It would be equally useful to know the life stories of people close to me, with whom I have been with for a very long time (and recently too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not possible to devote enough time to communicating with relatives. On weekends and holidays it will be possible to make up for it and spend time in pleasant company&lt;/p&gt;
