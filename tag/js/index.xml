      <description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript was originally created to &amp;ldquo;make web pages live.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs in this language are called scripts. They can be embedded in HTML and executed automatically when a web page loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripts are distributed and executed as plain text. They don&amp;rsquo;t need special preparation or compilation to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distinguishes JavaScript from another language – Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When JavaScript was created, it had a different name – &amp;ldquo;LiveScript&amp;rdquo;. However, the Java language was very popular at the time, and it was decided that positioning JavaScript as the &amp;ldquo;younger brother&amp;rdquo; of Java would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, JavaScript has become a completely independent language with its own specification, called ECMAScript, and now has nothing to do with Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today JavaScript can be executed not only in the browser, but also on the server or on any other device that has a special program called the JavaScript &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser has its own engine, which is sometimes called a &amp;ldquo;JavaScript virtual machine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
